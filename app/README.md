## üèóÔ∏è Future Gemma 3n Integration

While this demo uses mock AI responses, the architecture is designed for seamless Gemma 3n integration:

```typescript
// Planned integration with Google AI Edge
import { GemmaModel } from '@google-ai-edge/litert-web';

const processUserInput = async (audioInput: Blob, screenImage?: string) => {
  const response = await gemmaModel.generateResponse({
    audio: audioInput,
    image: screenImage,
    context: "elderly smartphone assistance"
  });
  
  return response.guidance;
};
```
